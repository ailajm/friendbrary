## Stage 1: Conceptualization
### Identify Core Features
* User registration and login.
* Ability to catalog physical books by entering details or scanning ISBNs.
* A database of books that can be searched and filtered.
* Friend system to connect users.
* Sharing of book library with friends.
* Request to borrow books from friends.
* Notifications for borrow requests and reminders.
* Review and rating system for books and borrowers.

### User Experience Design
* Sketching wireframes for the app interface.
* Deciding on the app's flow from the user's perspective.
* Considering how users will interact with each other.

### Research
* Investigating the legal implications of book sharing.
* Looking into potential APIs for book data retrieval (Google Books, Open Library, etc.).

## Stage 2: Technical Planning
### Define the Tech Stack
* Front-end: React (for web) and React Native (for iOS and Android).
* Back-end: Node.js with Express.js (which will work well with TypeScript).
* Database: MySQL for structured book and user data.
* Authentication: OAuth/JWT for secure logins.
* Cloud hosting services for the database and back-end (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.).

### Architecture Design
* Outlining the server-client model.
* Planning the database schema.
* Designing the RESTful API endpoints.

### Development Environment Setup
* Configuring TypeScript with React/React Native.
* Setting up MySQL database and connection with the back-end.
* Preparing development, testing, and production environments.

## Stage 3: Development
### Front-End Development
* Implementing the UI based on the wireframes.
* Developing the front-end logic in TypeScript.
* Ensuring responsive design for multiple devices.

### Back-End Development
* Setting up the Node.js server with Express.js.
* Creating API endpoints for user actions.
* Integrating with a book data API.

### Database
* Designing and implementing the MySQL schema.
* Developing the logic for querying and updating records.

### Authentication
* Implementing a secure login system.
* Handling user sessions and data privacy.

### Testing
* Writing unit tests for both front-end and back-end.
* Conducting integration tests.
* User testing with a small group for feedback.

## Stage 4: Iteration and Feedback

### User Feedback 
* Releasing a beta version to a small group of users.
* Collecting and analyzing user feedback.
* Making adjustments based on suggestions and usability issues.

### Refinement
* Polishing UI/UX.
* Optimizing performance.
* Ensuring security best practices are in place.

### Documentation
* Creating developer and user documentation.
* Documenting API endpoints and their usage.

## Stage 5: Launch and Marketing
### Launch Preparation
* Setting up app store accounts for distribution.
* Preparing marketing materials (website, promotional content).

### Launch
* Publishing the app to web and mobile platforms.
* Monitoring initial user adoption and fixing any immediate issues.

### Post-Launch
* Developing a plan for user support and app updates.
* Gathering metrics for app usage and performance.

### Marketing
* Reaching out to book clubs and reading communities.
* Utilizing social media and online advertising.

## Stage 6: Maintenance and Growth
### User Support
* Implementing a system for user feedback and support tickets.
* Regular updates based on user requests and bug fixes.

### Feature Expansion
* Planning for additional features like social recommendations, book discussions, etc.
* Considering partnerships with libraries or local bookstores.

### Scaling
* Optimizing the app for larger user bases.
* Upgrading server and database capabilities as needed.

## MVP Details
### Features:
#### User Registration and Authentication
* Simple sign-up/sign-in process.
* Basic profile creation.

#### Book Cataloging
* Manual entry of book details (title, author, ISBN, and possibly cover image).
* List view to display the user's book collection.

#### Friend System
* Ability to send and accept friend requests.
* Viewing a friend's book collection.

#### Borrowing Mechanism
* A simple way to request to borrow a book from a friend.
* Notifications for the book owner to approve or deny requests.

#### Basic Search and Filter
* Functionality to search for books within your own and your friends' collections.
* Basic filters, such as by author or title.

### Technical Considerations:
#### Front-End
* Develop using React Native to cater to both iOS and Android if you're planning for a mobile app, or React if you're starting with a web application.
* Use a simple yet intuitive design that's easy to navigate.

#### Back-End
* A Node.js server with Express.js framework, taking advantage of TypeScript for added type-safety and better developer experience.
* RESTful API endpoints to handle user actions like registration, adding books, sending borrow requests, etc.

#### Database
* MySQL tables for users, books, friendships, and borrow requests.
* Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all app interactions.

#### Authentication
* Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication after user login.

### Testing and Feedback Collection:
#### Alpha Testing
* Share the app with a small group of friends.
* Encourage diverse interaction to test all the features.

#### Feedback Mechanism
* Create a simple feedback form within the app or use an external service to collect feedback.
* Be prepared to act on the feedback to improve the app.
